Agenda
1. IEEE Micromouse module progress
2. Follow setup steps in Google Colab
3. Delegate task:
	Valiant - DFS (Depth First Search Algorithm) - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/
	Jayden - BFS (Breadth First Search) - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/
	Alden - New Maze for BFS/DFS - https://github.com/mackorone/mms

Task objective:
1. Learn about each algorithm (The steps in the algorithm, how to implement in Python, draw/visualize the algorithm, create a short explanation that a form 3 student can understand)
2. Create mazes that are optimized for each algorithm (1 maze that has the shortest path if using DFS, and 1 for BFS)

Do's:
1. Read up on materials online. Plat forms such as Medium, Geek for Geeks, etc.
2. Find useful diagrams and illustrations.
3. Can find any code from GitHub, as long as you understand it. (for DFS/BFS/Creating New Mazes)

Deliverables:
1. Valiant - Explanation or Form 3 students about DFS
2. Jayden - Explanation for Form 3 students about BFS
3. Alden - Any Mazes with their files. Short explanation about the mazes.
